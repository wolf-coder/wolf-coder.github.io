* WIP Witty AI Wonders: A Lighthearted Look at some of my Projects

** Airbnb Clone
- This project involved developing a web-based application that mimics the functionality of the popular online marketplace for short-term rentals, Airbnb. I implemented features such as user authentication, property listings, search functionality, and reservations, resulting in a user-friendly and functional platform for short-term rental booking.

** Object Detection
- This project involved developing a model for object detection using deep learning techniques. I implemented object detection algorithms to detect objects in images and videos.

** Neural Style Transfer
- This project is about using deep learning techniques to transfer the style of one image to another. I implemented neural style transfer algorithms to create new and unique images.

** Time Series Analysis
- This project is about analyzing time-series data using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). I built RNN models and applied them to analyze time-series data and make predictions.
